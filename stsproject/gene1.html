            <h2>Ethical Concerns in Gene Therapy</h2>
            <p>
                This article discusses the ethical dilemmas associated with gene editing technologies like CRISPR and their potential implications for society. Gene therapy holds immense promise in treating and potentially curing a range of genetic disorders, but it also raises significant ethical questions that require careful consideration.

                One of the primary concerns revolves around the safety and long-term effects of gene therapy. While the technology is advancing rapidly, the potential risks, such as unintended genetic mutations or unforeseen consequences to future generations, remain largely unknown. Scientists and ethicists are grappling with the question of whether it is morally acceptable to alter the human genome when the long-term impact is still uncertain.

                Access and equity also pose significant ethical challenges. As gene therapy treatments can be prohibitively expensive, there is a growing fear that such technologies could become available only to the wealthy, exacerbating social inequalities. The concept of genetic enhancement—where individuals might choose traits for their children, such as physical appearance or intelligence—adds to the debate, raising fears about a future where genetic modification could lead to a form of new eugenics.

                Additionally, the use of gene editing in germline cells (which would pass changes to future generations) brings up concerns about the ethical boundaries of altering the human gene pool. Some argue that it could prevent inherited diseases, while others fear it could have far-reaching consequences that humanity is not yet prepared to manage. Furthermore, the potential misuse of gene-editing technologies, such as for creating biological weapons, highlights the need for strict international oversight and regulations.
